# Data frames

Many forms of data can be organized into *data tables*.  Data tables are often
called *data frames*.

A *data table* or *data frame* has rows and columns.

The rows may represent *observations*, such as people in a clinical trial, or
sports teams.  The columns represent *variables* - each variable is some type
of information about the *observations*.  For example, if the observations are
people in a clinical trial, the variables might be age, height, weight and
severity of disease. For a sports teams, they might be name, home city, number
of games played, number games lost, won and drawn.

You can think of data frames as a sequence of columns of data, where each column has the values for one variable.
