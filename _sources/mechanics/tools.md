# Tools

There are two main sets of tools in data science:

* The [Python](https://python.org) programming language, and its libraries,
  including [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for handling data in tables,
  and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for plotting.  Python is a general
  programming language that is excellent for teaching, but also for serious
  coding in business and academia.
* The [R language](https://www.r-project.org). The main page for R describes
  it as a "a free software environment for statistical computing and
  graphics".  R is a favorite for people who already know they need to do
  "statistics", and want the largest range of statistical routines.  R is the
  standard language used by statisticians.

Both languages have *Notebook environments*.

We will be using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) with Python.
